# NickFlix

###### NickFlix is wanted to be an project to enterntain myself (Something needed in this quarentine), improve and practice, my development knowlodges. I was a considerable time without developing any mobile applications, then i decided to create this project.

###### It will have 3 segments (Maybe 4, but meanwhile its still 3), we gonna build an application from scratch, mirroring on the Official Netflix as our reference. And NickFlix will try be a little different.

###### The 3 Principal Segments will be:

* ###### The Back-End (With PHP and Laravel)
* ###### The Front-End (With JavaScript and Vue.js)
* ###### The Mobile App (With JavaScript and React Native)
* ###### And maybe... The Desktop App (With JavaScript and Electron)
